# Project Repository

This repository contains three distinct projects focused on video processing and safety analytics:

## 1. Gender Detection
This project focuses on gender classification based on video or image data. The model can classify the gender of individuals in a video frame.

### Features:
- Real-time gender classification.
- Supports multiple individuals in a single frame.
- Can be integrated with surveillance systems.

### Technologies:
- OpenCV
- Pre-trained Machine Learning Models (e.g., Haar Cascades, CNN)

## 2. No. of People
This project involves video processing to detect and count the number of people crossing a line within a video frame. It leverages OpenCV and NumPy in Python to efficiently track and analyze movements.

### Features:
- Real-time object detection and tracking.
- Counting of people crossing a predefined line.
- Output visualization with annotated frames.

### Technologies:
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## 3. SOS Model
The SOS Model is designed to detect situations where a person might be in distress. It uses gesture analytics and other contextual data to recognize SOS gestures and alert the appropriate authorities or contacts.

### Features:
- Real-time SOS gesture recognition.
- Gender-based analytics to identify situations of distress.
- Integration with notification systems for immediate response.

### Technologies:
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Custom Gesture Recognition Algorithms
